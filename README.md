### Why
I was little bored so I thinked of trying to create profesional web site, in style of some corporation.
Maybe it doesn't look like great but it's something close (As I think).
And I was trying to use pure html and css but css can't affect element when other element is clicked (even for while) so cookie bar is closed by javascript.

### How to
To see it just git clone this repository and open `index.html` in browser.

### Also
Code isn't made great, I realized it after some time.
